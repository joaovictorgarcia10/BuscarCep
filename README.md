## Organization

### /modules

The main features of the application, here the principle of modularization was applied, so that each module implements everything necessary for its own operation.

### /shared

Here we'll have the fundamental functionality to all the modules, implementations like shared features, generic errors and some utilities that can be acessed to the entire application.

## Layers
